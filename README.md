# AngularNewsApp

Get Your api_key at https://newsapi.org/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Development server


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

In this application I learned how to get data from Api and show it on front-end.
Used angular material to create responsive menu and tailwind to show news.
